# Overview

RowScript is a new JavaScript dialect that aims to greatly improve the ergonomics for **2 types of web developers**:

* **Application writers**: Users should write their apps with powerful tools, frameworks **and** a versatile type system
* **Library writers**: Users should write their libraries with less [type challenges], which are generally cluttering and
  non-trivial

With RowScript, you can write more extensible and scalable code using its tool and type system.
